# Data Formats

There are numerous options within the metadata record to record date values. Dates enable machines to improve search results and humans to determine the relevancy and ‘fitness for use’ of the resource. To clarify the action associated with the date, ISO date elements require a companion date type code. The following date types are most useful in assessing a resource:  creation  publication  lastUpdate (ISO19115-1) / revision (ISO 19115)
