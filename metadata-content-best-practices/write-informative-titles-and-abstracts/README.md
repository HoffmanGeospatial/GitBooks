# Write Informative Titles and Abstracts

## <mark style="color:blue;background-color:blue;">Titles</mark>

A good title is descriptive and distinctive. It provides data consumers a good sense of the resource content and context and enables them to distinguish among similar resources. Titles should not try to replace an Abstract or Purpose statement, but they should strive to relay the what, when, where and, if relevant, the who, why, and how of the resource. For example:

* What feature or feature collection does the resource represent?&#x20;
* When did the content occur or when was it captured?&#x20;
* Where is the content located on the earth?&#x20;
* Who is the authority for the resource?&#x20;
* Why was the resource created?&#x20;
* How is the resource formatted?

**Title example:** \
&#xNAN;_&#x41;quifer Systems and Recharge Potential in Louisiana, Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinatorâ€™s Office (LOSCO), 2020, \[aqrgeog3dpdeq.shp]_



## <mark style="color:blue;">Abstracts</mark>

A good abstract provides the information necessary for data consumers to assess the relevance of an available data resource to their specific data needs. To meet this objective, the abstract should include:&#x20;

* a general description of the data resource content and features&#x20;
* the form of the data resource, e.g. GIS, imagery, database, service, application, etc.&#x20;
* the purpose for which the data resource was developed&#x20;
* relevant place names and references&#x20;
* the time period of the data resource content&#x20;
* the resolution of the resource&#x20;
* information about special data characteristics or limitations, e.g. data access limitations, excluded geographies or content, completeness, etc.
