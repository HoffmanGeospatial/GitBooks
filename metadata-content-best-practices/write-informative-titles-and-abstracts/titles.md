# Titles

A good title is descriptive and distinctive. It provides data consumers a good sense of the resource content and context and enables them to distinguish among similar resources. Titles should not try to replace an Abstract or Purpose statement, but they should strive to relay the what, when, where and, if relevant, the who, why, and how of the resource. For example:

* What feature or feature collection does the resource represent?&#x20;
* When did the content occur or when was it captured?&#x20;
* Where is the content located on the earth?&#x20;
* Who is the authority for the resource?&#x20;
* Why was the resource created?&#x20;
* How is the resource formatted?

**Title example:** \
