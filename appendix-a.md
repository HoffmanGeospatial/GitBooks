### Original EBK

The original GEOINT EBK was developed in 2014 by conducting a cross-industry job analysis led by psychometric consultants and with the help of members of the GEOINT Community. The goal of the analysis was to identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities critical to the GEOINT workforce. Qualified Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from government, industry, and academia participated in each phase of the job/practice analysis to ensure accurate reflection of GEOINT practices. The original GEOINT EBK described the geospatial intelligence discipline and practice in terms of key job tasks and essential knowledge, skills, and abilities required for a professional to be successful. The four competency areas presented in the original GEOINT EBK are described below:



### EBK 2.0

The GEOINT EBK version 2.0 revision began in August 2017 with a survey of 88 respondents from the GEOINT community to identify critical knowledge and skills not accounted for in the first version of the EBK. Following the survey, eight SMEs provided guidance on the interpretation of the survey results and agreed upon appropriate topic areas that were necessary to include in each of the four competencies. The draft version of the GEOINT EBK version 2.0 was presented to USGIF’s Certification Governance Board (CGB), which requested the appointment of authors to lead the development and review of the new content. Five SMEs subsequently expanded the content, each leading and developing content for indexing the knowledge and skills necessary to address each topic area at the specified proficiency level.\
\
The EBK 2.0 included a matrix tool for each competency so the content would be more comprehensive. The matrix comprised four different proficiency levels within the Major Topic Areas to allow for granularity (i.e., Prerequisites, Foundational, Application, and Mastery). Subtopics reflected knowledge and skills necessary to master the major topic areas and learning objectives that describe what is expected of the GEOINT Community at the given proficiency level. The proficiency levels include corresponding questions designed to prompt readers to use the information at the appropriate level:\

### EBK 3.0

The EBK 3.0 revision process began in late 2022 with the USGIF Education and Professional Development (EPD) team engaging in interviews with 12 professors from USGIF-accredited GEOINT certificate and degree programs. These professors are acknowledged as contributors to this updated document. The EPD team also held discussions with SMEs from government, including from the NGA College, and stakeholders from industry, particularly those with perspectives centered on hiring and the current job ecosystem.\
\
These conversations focused on what technologies and skills were missing and what may be already outdated within the EBK 2.0. The EPD team investigated how the EBK 2.0 covered core topics as well as non-technical or “soft skills.” When interviewing the professors, we were particularly interested in areas in which they had already modernized their coursework to cover skills beyond what is in the EBK 2.0. As the EPD team updated the EBK 2.0, each section was sent to multiple subject-matter experts for their input and review.\
\
Because the EBK 2.0 revision was such an extensive review, much of the content of EBK 3.0 has remained the same. This version features a restructuring and reorganization of matrix subtopics and learning objectives. By grouping related learning objectives within the same subtopic, the goal is for learners to better understand how each learning objective fits within the broader competency. The intent was to make this document more approachable and useful for practitioners at all skill levels to assess their proficiency and understand where they need to grow their knowledge base. This version keeps pace with current geospatial intelligence trends and the needs of the GEOINT community across academia, industry, and government.
