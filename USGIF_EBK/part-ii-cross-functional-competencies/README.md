# PART II: Cross-Functional Competencies

**Cross-Functional competencies** describe the multitude of non-technical skills a student needs when entering the workforce.

Cross-functional GEOINT knowledge, skills, and abilities reflect:&#x20;

* Qualitative non-technical or “soft skills” used by most GEOINTers&#x20;
* Unique aspects of the GEOINT tradecraft applicable to the majority of practitioners&#x20;
* Common GEOINT knowledge and practices that, if followed, will improve the performance of a practitioner
